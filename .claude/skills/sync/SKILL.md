# Sync Agent State

Synchronize the local agent state with the remote GitHub repository. This performs a pull-rebase-push workflow.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Quick sync
git fetch origin && git pull --rebase origin main && git push origin main
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch and Check Status

```bash
git fetch origin
git status
git branch --show-current
git status -sb  # Remote tracking status
```

Check for unpushed commits:
```bash
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "No remote tracking yet"
```

### Step 2: Pull Changes (with rebase)

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

**If conflicts occur:**

1. List conflicting files:
   ```bash
   git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
   ```

2. Show conflict markers in each file

3. Ask user how to resolve:
   - Keep ours
   - Keep theirs
   - Manual merge

4. After resolution:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-files>
   git rebase --continue
   ```

### Step 3: Push Local Commits

```bash
git push origin main
```

**If push fails (rejected due to remote changes):**
1. Pull again with rebase
2. Resolve any new conflicts
3. Push again

## Safety Checks

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Uncommitted changes | Warn user, suggest `/commit` first |
| Force push requested | NEVER without explicit approval |
| Large push (>10 commits) | Show what will be pushed, confirm |

## Post-Sync Report

After successful sync, report:
- Number of commits pulled
- Number of commits pushed
- Current sync status with remote

```
Sync complete:
- Pulled: 3 commits from origin/main
- Pushed: 2 commits to origin/main
- Status: Up to date with remote
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Merge conflicts | Divergent history | Resolve manually, then continue |
| Push rejected | Remote has new commits | Pull first, then push |
| Authentication failed | SSH key or credentials | Check git remote, re-auth |
| Detached HEAD | Not on a branch | `git checkout main` |

## Important Notes

- **Never force push** without explicit user approval
- **Always show what will be pushed** before pushing
- **Warn about uncommitted changes** before sync
- For Trinity deployment, ensure deploy key is properly configured
